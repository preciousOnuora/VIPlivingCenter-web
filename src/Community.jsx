            <p>
            Our Life Enrichment program is far from cookie-cutter. We continually evaluate and add new programs to engage our residents in meaningful ways.
Life Enrichment coordinators plan a rotating calendar of engaging activities, including music therapy, art, trivia, book clubs, bonsai classes, foosball competitions, and so much more!
We leverage technology to enhance our programs, like ZOOM, to allow our less ambulatory residents to be part of a gourmet club cook-off with our kitchen staff.

            Expert training and attention to detail are the cornerstones of caregiving. Our staff forms tight bonds with residents and their families. They often compare caring for residents to caring for a member of their own family.
Our staff knows each resident intimately. They proactively care for residents and notice changes in their condition quickly.
A nurse is on staff to oversee and customize care plans for each resident and can communicate concerns to the primary care physician.
Available medical referral services include a shortlist of recommended primary care doctors, physical and occupational therapists, podiatrists, geriatric psychiatrists, nearby pharmacies providing free medication delivery, mobile blood work, labs, and X-ray vendors.

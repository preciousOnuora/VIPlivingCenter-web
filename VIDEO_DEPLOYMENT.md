# 🎥 Video Deployment Guide

## Why Videos Are Excluded from Git

Your video file (`src/Videos/vipvideo.mp4`) is **265 MB** - this is too large for git repositories and causes:
- ❌ Slow git operations
- ❌ Failed pushes to GitHub
- ❌ Repository bloat
- ❌ Poor performance

## 🚀 How to Deploy Your Video

### Option 1: Upload to YouTube/Vimeo (Recommended)
1. **Upload your video** to YouTube or Vimeo
2. **Get the embed code** from the share options
3. **Replace the video import** in `src/Home.jsx` with the embed code

### Option 2: Host on Your Web Server
1. **Upload the video** to your hosting service's public folder
2. **Update the video path** in your code to point to the hosted URL
3. **Example**: Change from `./Videos/vipvideo.mp4` to `https://yourdomain.com/videos/vipvideo.mp4`

### Option 3: Use a CDN Service
- **Cloudinary** (free tier available)
- **AWS S3** (very cheap)
- **Google Cloud Storage**

## 📝 Current Video Usage

Your video is currently imported in:
```javascript
// src/Home.jsx line 10
import welcomeVideo from './Videos/vipvideo.mp4';
```

## 🔧 Quick Fix for Development

If you want to keep using the local video during development:

1. **Keep the video file** in `src/Videos/vipvideo.mp4`
2. **Don't commit it** to git (it's now ignored)
3. **Upload it separately** when deploying to production

## 📱 Production Deployment

When deploying to production:
1. **Upload the video** to your hosting service
2. **Update the video path** in your code
3. **Test the video** loads correctly

## 💡 Best Practice

For production websites, always host videos on:
- **Video platforms** (YouTube, Vimeo)
- **CDN services** (Cloudinary, AWS)
- **Your web server** (if you have control)

Never commit large media files to git repositories!
